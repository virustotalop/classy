# classyjava

An attempt to write a half-decent textbook by an undergraduate student.

Written as an exercise to teach programming, specifically Java, from the ground up.

## Should I learn from this

No, at least not right now, the book is no where near completion.

## Why?

I've always wanted to teach people computer science, I'm most familiar with Java
and I wanted to see if I could even attempt to write a text book.
